# Would You Rather App
---

## Project Purpose:

This game was built as a  project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based web app.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter.  If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app and run
```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-maris/would-you-rather.git
npm install
```

To start the development server run
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## How to Use the App
